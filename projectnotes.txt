MVP v1:
- TODO: Authentication [DONE]
- API endpoint: Return list of events of logged in user [DONE]
- API endpoint: Create event and associate it with the logged in user [DONE]
	- Event creation takes in:
		- name of event
		- place
		- time the event takes place
	
- API endpoint: Detail page of event [DONE]
	- Returns:
		- name of event
		- people involved (and how they're involved, what their position is in the event)
		- place
		- time the event takes place


Last thing I did:
- I was updating the code in the server, tried "git pull" but asked me to stash the changes made to the files.
- But the db.sqlite3 was also changed and had to be stashed. So I did that. And now the db file that was there in the server
- is no longer there (it's in the stashed commit), and instead the db in the server is the one that was in my local machine.
- Next there was a problem with the permissions on the db file in the server, so I chown'd it to www-data. Fixed the issue.
- Now, there pops this issue that is described below. Good luck!

Next:
- Posting event in Postman creates an error. You can see it in the error.log in the server.
