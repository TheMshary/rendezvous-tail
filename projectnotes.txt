MVP v1:
- TODO: Authentication [DONE]
- API endpoint: Return list of events of logged in user [DONE]
- API endpoint: Create event and associate it with the logged in user [DONE]
	- Event creation takes in:
		- name of event
		- place
		- time the event takes place
	
- API endpoint: Detail page of event [DONE]
	- Returns:
		- name of event
		- people involved (and how they're involved, what their position is in the event)
		- place
		- time the event takes place


Last thing I did:
- Fixed yesterday's server/database issue by reverting to previous commit

Next:
- Start with the inviting system. Start with the view that does single invite request.
