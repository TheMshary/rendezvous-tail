Icebox:
- GET /events returns three lists: attending, invites, and created. The events in created are not also in attending. Should they be? Should the created events also be in the attending list? I don't think so now that I think about it.
- Make sure the HTTP response codes match the RESTful standards



Last thing I did:
- Redesigned the URI scheme for the API in "urls.py".

Next:
- Update the views such that they reflect the changes to the API structure.
